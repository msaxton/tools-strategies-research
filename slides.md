### Develop a carefully articulated research question
* A well-crafted research question will focus your research and keep you from information overload.
* The answer to your research question can serve as your thesis statement.

#### Preliminary research
* Preliminary research is a necessary first step to a well-crafted research question.
* Tools for preliminary research:
    * [Library Guide - English Literature: Resources for Graduate Research](https://tufts.libapps.com/libguides/admin_c.php?g=769182)
    * [Oxford Bibliographies](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=OBO)


### Maintain a research log
A research log is an informal way of documenting your research progress. It is an effective way to keep track of your database searches as well as your notes on sources. Research logs are useful because they track your progress, store your notes, and encourage you to be reflective on your research and reading.

#### Three parts of a research log
* A record of database searches
* Source notes
* Annotated bibliography

#### Example research log

### Take efficient notes

Discussion: What's your experience with note taking? 

#### A few tips

Only write down information useful for answering your research question.
* (But do allow you research question to develop in the process.)

Take atomized notes.

Use your own words as often as you can.

Clearly distinguish between quotes, paraphrases, summaries, and your own thoughts.

If you write down a quotation, also make a note about *why* the quotation was worth writing down.

Before writing your paper, reorganize your notes thematically.

"A thoughtful, judicious selection of material from your reading should be followed by a thoughtful, judicious selection from your own notes when the time comes to write" (Brundage, *Going to the Source*, 121).

#### Tools for note taking
* Pen and paper
* Word processor (i.e. Microsoft Word or Google Docs)
